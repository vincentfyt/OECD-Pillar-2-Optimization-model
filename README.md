# OECD Pillar 2 Optimization Model

## Abstract

This paper develops a dynamic closed-form framework for analyzing OECD Pillar 2 mechanisms (QDMTT, IIR, UTPR) with endogenous covered tax determination and strategic GloBE income allocation. Unlike existing approaches that treat covered taxes as exogenous parameters or view Pillar 2 as purely static compliance exercise, my research framework recognizes that multinational enterprises possess substantial transfer pricing flexibility within arm's length ranges. This flexibility makes covered taxes endogenous functions of strategic GloBE income allocation decisions, fundamentally altering the optimization landscape. I present a progressive four-tier modeling framework: (I) static simplified optimization with endogenous tax base, (II) penalty-augmented risk management incorporating audit costs, (III) negative income handling with piecewise tax functions, and (IV) multi-period time value integration. Each model tier addresses specific real-world complexities while maintaining mathematical rigor and computational tractability. I believe that the framework facilitates strategic tax optimization while ensuring regulatory compliance, providing both theoretical insights and practical implementation guidance for sophisticated multinational tax planning under Pillar 2. This working paper presents a preliminary theoretical framework that awaits empirical validation. The author welcomes feedback, critiques, and suggestions as the computational platform is being developed for practical implementation.
